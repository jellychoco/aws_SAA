# EC2 BASIC

### 1. EC2 Nitro

    - Undelying Platform for the next generation of EC2 instances
    - New virtualization technology
    - Allows for better performance
        - Better netwroking options (enhanced networking, HPC, IPv6)
        - Higher Speed EBS (Nitro is necessary for 64,000 EBS IOPS - max 32,000 on non-Nitro) **
    - Better underlying security

### 2. vCPU

    -  vCPU is cpu * thread per cpu
    - exmaple: 4CPU * 2thread per CPU = 8vCPU

### 3. OptimizING CPU options

    - Less thread is better performance for instance

### 4. Capacity Reservations

    - Capacity Reservations ensure you have EC2 Capacity when needed
    - Manual or planned end-date for the reservation
    - No need for 1 or 3year commitment
    - Capacity access is immediate, you get billed as soon as it starts

### 5. Placement Group

    1. Cluster : clusters instances into a low-latency group in a single AZ
    2. Spread : sperads instances across underlying hardware
    3. Partition : instances across many difrrent partitions (Hadoop, Cassandra, Kafka)
