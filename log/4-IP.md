# IP

## 1. Private vs Public

- IPv4 : 1.160.10.240
- IPv6 : 1900:4545:3:200:f8ff:fe21:67cf
- IPv4 is still the most common format used online
- IPv6 is newer and solves problems for the internet of things

### Fundamental Differences

1. Public IP:

   - Public IP means the machine can be identified on the internet (WWW)
   - Must be unique across the whole web (not two machines can have the same public IP address)
   - Can be geo-located easily

2. Pirvate IP:
   - Private IP means the machine can only be identified on a private network only
   - The IP must be unique across the private network
   - BUT two different private networks (two companies) can have the same IPs
   - Machinee connect to WWW using a NAT + internet gateway (a proxy)
